# Distillation-Gym
<br>
Currently being build
<br>
Designing chemical engineering processes with reinforcement learning
<br>
Using COCO simulator and ChemSep to simulate hydrocarbon distillation train process synthesis problem
<br>

## Agents
  - Soft Actor Critic (SAC), best performer
  - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
  
  
## TODO
  - Not getting speedup from asynchronous run (due to ChemSep + COCO?) 
  - Once asynch problem with simulators gets fixed will need to rewrite all the asynch code as it is now all old + buggy + requires many updates
